# Movie recommendations using RASA + TigerGraph

Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) intend to return the best recommendations to users through a multi-turn interactive conversation. CRS allows users to provide their feedback during the conversation, unlike the traditional recommendation systems. CRS can combine the knowledge of the predefined user profile with the current user requirements to output custom yet most relevant recommendations or suggestions. This work will implement a chatbot using the open-source chatbot development framework - RASA and the most powerful, super-fast and leading cloud graph database - TigerGraph.
